# XTTS Model Configuration Parameters
# Copy this file to .env and adjust values as needed

# Temperature: Controls randomness in generation (0.0-1.0)
# Higher = more creative/varied, Lower = more deterministic
# Original working value: 0.3, Model config: 0.85
XTTS_TEMPERATURE=0.3

# Length Penalty: Controls audio length (typically 0.5-2.0)
# Higher = longer audio, Lower = shorter audio
XTTS_LENGTH_PENALTY=1.0

# Repetition Penalty: Prevents word/sound repetition (typically 1.0-15.0)
# Higher = less repetition, Lower = allows more repetition
# Original working value: 10.0, Model config: 2.0
# NOTE: High values (10.0) work better for this specific model/use case
XTTS_REPETITION_PENALTY=10.0

# Top K: Limits vocabulary to top K tokens
# Higher = more variety, Lower = more focused
# Original working value: 30, Model config: 50
XTTS_TOP_K=30

# Top P: Nucleus sampling threshold (0.0-1.0)
# Higher = more variety, Lower = more focused
XTTS_TOP_P=0.85

# Additional Quality Parameters
# do_sample: Enable nucleus sampling (True recommended)
XTTS_DO_SAMPLE=True

# speed: Audio speed multiplier (1.0 = normal speed)
XTTS_SPEED=1.0

# enable_text_splitting: Split long texts for better processing
XTTS_ENABLE_TEXT_SPLITTING=True

# Experimental: Try these values if you want to test model config defaults
# XTTS_TEMPERATURE=0.85
# XTTS_REPETITION_PENALTY=2.0
# XTTS_TOP_K=50

# Audio Post-Processing Parameters
# keep_silence_duration: Silence to keep at end of audio (in seconds)
# Lower values (0.1-0.2) = better for short text (less stretched audio)
# Higher values (0.5-0.8) = better for long text (more natural pauses)
XTTS_KEEP_SILENCE_DURATION=0.2
